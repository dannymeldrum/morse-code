# Talk In Code
## The Morse Code Generator Tool


###Application Overview
The Talk In Code piece is a website that converts any message supplied by the user into Morse Code to share with friends. The user types their chosen message and clicks the "Translate my message to Morse Code" button to generate Morse code output in their browser which they can then share with friends on the usual social networks.


###Your task
The purpose of this task is to create a fully functioning application which is fully responsive by leveraging front end code languages, tools and techniques (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The solution should work across all supported browsers (see supported browser list further down the page).


###User flow
This should be built as a single page. The user flow is demonstrated by the 3 flat JPGs in the exports directory. These are as follows;

- Landing page with text input
- Result page with Morse code output
- Share it pop ups for Twitter / Facebook / Google plus


###Resources
A layered PSD is supplied.

A _fonts directory is included with all fonts used within the piece. How you serve the fonts is up to you, for example you may choose to use fonts from third party services.

There is also a list-of-letters-with-morse-codes.txt file that includes the morse code for every letter of the alphabet.


###Deliverables
You should supply:

* A zip file which should contain:

 *  An original version which contains all the raw source files (e.g. SASS) and any build process scripts (e.g. Grunt) you may have created/used.

 *  A compiled 'go live' version of your solution, ready to go on a website/server.

* A link to the 'go live' version of your solution that is publicly available online (e.g. www.mysite.com/talk-in-code/
